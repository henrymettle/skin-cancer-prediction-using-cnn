# skin-cancer-prediction-using-cnn

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict skin cancer from dermoscopic images. The model is designed to classify three major types of skin cancer; namely melanoma,basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma , assisting in the early detection and treatment of skin cancer.

Introduction
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. Early detection is critical for effective treatment. This project aims to utilize deep learning, specifically CNNs, to predict the presence of skin cancer from dermoscopic images with high accuracy.

Model Architecture
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
The model uses multiple convolutional layers to automatically extract features from dermoscopic images.
Fully connected layers are used for final classification, determining whether the skin lesion is benign or malignant.
